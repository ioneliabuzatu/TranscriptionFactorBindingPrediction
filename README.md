The Challenge:

* Develop an algorithm for transcription factor binding event prediction.
* Identify where in the first 100,000 bases of chromosome 1 the MYC transcription factor is most likely to bind.
* Write a report on your results.


> Most likely binding site prediction from main.py 
```

The most likely binding site is at position <19244> in the reference genome
The predicted binding site in the ref genome: CCACGTGC
The original pattern to be found: GGCCACGTGCCC
